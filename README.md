# issue-tracker

Fun fact! If you type this in vscode:

```
div.rating-container
```

and hit tab it will turn it into:

```
<div class="rating-container">
```

So we want our feedback form to be in a div container. And we want it to have the phrase in <strong>:

```
<strong>What's on your mind?</strong>
```
